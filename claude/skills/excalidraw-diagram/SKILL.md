# Excalidraw Diagram Creator

Generate `.excalidraw` JSON files that **argue visually**, not just display information.

**Note:** PNG rendering is DISABLED for this skill. Never run the render script or create `.png` files — deliver the `.excalidraw` JSON only and self-review it (see the **Self-Review** section).

## Customization

**All colors and brand-specific styles live in one file:** `references/color-palette.md`. Read it before generating any diagram and use it as the single source of truth for all color choices — shape fills, strokes, text colors, evidence artifact backgrounds, everything.

To make this skill produce diagrams in your own brand style, edit `color-palette.md`. Everything else in this file is universal design methodology and Excalidraw best practices.

## Core Philosophy

**Diagrams should ARGUE, not DISPLAY.**

A diagram isn't formatted text. It's a visual argument that shows relationships, causality, and flow that words alone can't express. The shape should BE the meaning.

**The Isomorphism Test**: If you removed all text, would the structure alone communicate the concept? If not, redesign.

**The Education Test**: Could someone learn something concrete from this diagram, or does it just label boxes? A good diagram teaches—it shows actual formats, real event names, concrete examples.

---

## Depth Assessment (Do This First)

Before designing, determine what level of detail this diagram needs:

### Simple/Conceptual Diagrams
Use abstract shapes when:
- Explaining a mental model or philosophy
- The audience doesn't need technical specifics
- The concept IS the abstraction (e.g., "separation of concerns")

### Comprehensive/Technical Diagrams
Use concrete examples when:
- Diagramming a real system, protocol, or architecture
- The diagram will be used to teach or explain (e.g., YouTube video)
- The audience needs to understand what things actually look like
- You're showing how multiple technologies integrate

**For technical diagrams, you MUST include evidence artifacts** (see below).

---

## Research Mandate (For Technical Diagrams)

**Before drawing anything technical, research the actual specifications.**

If you're diagramming a protocol, API, or framework:
1. Look up the actual JSON/data formats
2. Find the real event names, method names, or API endpoints
3. Understand how the pieces actually connect
4. Use real terminology, not generic placeholders

Bad: "Protocol" → "Frontend"
Good: "AG-UI streams events (RUN_STARTED, STATE_DELTA, A2UI_UPDATE)" → "CopilotKit renders via createA2UIMessageRenderer()"

**Research makes diagrams accurate AND educational.**

---

## Evidence Artifacts

Evidence artifacts are concrete examples that prove your diagram is accurate and help viewers learn. Include them in technical diagrams.

**Types of evidence artifacts** (choose what's relevant to your diagram):

| Artifact Type | When to Use | How to Render |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Code snippets** | APIs, integrations, implementation details | Dark rectangle + syntax-colored text (see color palette for evidence artifact colors) |
| **Data/JSON examples** | Data formats, schemas, payloads | Dark rectangle + colored text (see color palette) |
| **Event/step sequences** | Protocols, workflows, lifecycles | Timeline pattern (line + dots + labels) |
| **UI mockups** | Showing actual output/results | Nested rectangles mimicking real UI |
| **Real input content** | Showing what goes IN to a system | Rectangle with sample content visible |
| **API/method names** | Real function calls, endpoints | Use actual names from docs, not placeholders |

**Example**: For a diagram about a streaming protocol, you might show:
- The actual event names from the spec (not just "Event 1", "Event 2")
- A code snippet showing how to connect
- What the streamed data actually looks like

**Example**: For a diagram about a data transformation pipeline:
- Show sample input data (actual format, not "Input")
- Show sample output data (actual format, not "Output")
- Show intermediate states if relevant

The key principle: **show what things actually look like**, not just what they're called.

---

## Multi-Zoom Architecture

Comprehensive diagrams operate at multiple zoom levels simultaneously. Think of it like a map that shows both the country borders AND the street names.

### Level 1: Summary Flow
A simplified overview showing the full pipeline or process at a glance. Often placed at the top or bottom of the diagram.

*Example*: `Input → Processing → Output` or `Client → Server → Database`

### Level 2: Section Boundaries
Labeled regions that group related components. These create visual "rooms" that help viewers understand what belongs together.

*Example*: Grouping by responsibility (Backend / Frontend), by phase (Setup / Execution / Cleanup), or by team (User / System / External)

### Level 3: Detail Inside Sections
Evidence artifacts, code snippets, and concrete examples within each section. This is where the educational value lives.

*Example*: Inside a "Backend" section, you might show the actual API response format, not just a box labeled "API Response"

**For comprehensive diagrams, aim to include all three levels.** The summary gives context, the sections organize, and the details teach.

### Bad vs Good

| Bad (Displaying) | Good (Arguing) |
|------------------|----------------|
| 5 equal boxes with labels | Each concept has a shape that mirrors its behavior |
| Card grid layout | Visual structure matches conceptual structure |
| Icons decorating text | Shapes that ARE the meaning |
| Same container for everything | Distinct visual vocabulary per concept |
| Everything in a box | Free-floating text with selective containers |

### Simple vs Comprehensive (Know Which You Need)

| Simple Diagram | Comprehensive Diagram |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Generic labels: "Input" → "Process" → "Output" | Specific: shows what the input/output actually looks like |
| Named boxes: "API", "Database", "Client" | Named boxes + examples of actual requests/responses |
| "Events" or "Messages" label | Timeline with real event/message names from the spec |
| "UI" or "Dashboard" rectangle | Mockup showing actual UI elements and content |
| ~30 seconds to explain | ~2-3 minutes of teaching content |
| Viewer learns the structure | Viewer learns the structure AND the details |

**Simple diagrams** are fine for abstract concepts, quick overviews, or when the audience already knows the details. **Comprehensive diagrams** are needed for technical architectures, tutorials, educational content, or when you want the diagram itself to teach.

---

## Container vs. Free-Floating Text

**Not every piece of text needs a shape around it.** Default to free-floating text. Add containers only when they serve a purpose.

| Use a Container When... | Use Free-Floating Text When... |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| It's the focal point of a section | It's a label or description |
| It needs visual grouping with other elements | It's supporting detail or metadata |
| Arrows need to connect to it | It describes something nearby |
| The shape itself carries meaning (decision diamond, etc.) | Typography alone creates sufficient hierarchy |
| It represents a distinct "thing" in the system | It's a section title, subtitle, or annotation |

**Typography as hierarchy**: Use font size, weight, and color to create visual hierarchy without boxes. A 28px title doesn't need a rectangle around it.

**The container test**: For each boxed element, ask "Would this work as free-floating text?" If yes, remove the container.

---

## Design Process (Do This BEFORE Generating JSON)

### Step 0: Assess Depth Required
Before anything else, determine if this needs to be:
- **Simple/Conceptual**: Abstract shapes, labels, relationships (mental models, philosophies)
- **Comprehensive/Technical**: Concrete examples, code snippets, real data (systems, architectures, tutorials)

**If comprehensive**: Do research first. Look up actual specs, formats, event names, APIs.

### Step 1: Understand Deeply
Read the content. For each concept, ask:
- What does this concept **DO**? (not what IS it)
- What relationships exist between concepts?
- What's the core transformation or flow?
- **What would someone need to SEE to understand this?** (not just read about)

### Step 2: Map Concepts to Patterns
For each concept, find the visual pattern that mirrors its behavior:

| If the concept... | Use this pattern |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Spawns multiple outputs | **Fan-out** (radial arrows from center) |
| Combines inputs into one | **Convergence** (funnel, arrows merging) |
| Has hierarchy/nesting | **Tree** (lines + free-floating text) |
| Is a sequence of steps | **Timeline** (line + dots + free-floating labels) |
| Loops or improves continuously | **Spiral/Cycle** (arrow returning to start) |
| Is an abstract state or context | **Cloud** (overlapping ellipses) |
| Transforms input to output | **Assembly line** (before → process → after) |
| Compares two things | **Side-by-side** (parallel with contrast) |
| Separates into phases | **Gap/Break** (visual separation between sections) |

### Step 3: Ensure Variety
For multi-concept diagrams: **each major concept must use a different visual pattern**. No uniform cards or grids.

### Step 4: Sketch the Flow
Before JSON, mentally trace how the eye moves through the diagram. There should be a clear visual story.

### Step 5: Generate JSON
Only now create the Excalidraw elements. **See below for how to handle large diagrams.**

### Step 6: Self-Review the JSON (no rendering)
PNG rendering is DISABLED for this skill. Do NOT run the render script and do NOT create any `.png` files. Instead, re-read your JSON and mentally simulate the layout: overlapping coordinates, containers wide enough for their text, arrows bound to the right elements, balanced spacing. Fix issues directly in the JSON. See the **Self-Review** section below.

---

## Large / Comprehensive Diagram Strategy

**For comprehensive or technical diagrams, you MUST build the JSON one section at a time.** Do NOT attempt to generate the entire file in a single pass. This is a hard constraint — Claude Code has a ~32,000 token output limit per response, and a comprehensive diagram easily exceeds that in one shot. Even if it didn't, generating everything at once leads to worse quality. Section-by-section is better in every way.

### The Section-by-Section Workflow

**Phase 1: Build each section**

1. **Create the base file** with the JSON wrapper (`type`, `version`, `appState`, `files`) and the first section of elements.
2. **Add one section per edit.** Each section gets its own dedicated pass — take your time with it. Think carefully about the layout, spacing, and how this section connects to what's already there.
3. **Use descriptive string IDs** (e.g., `"trigger_rect"`, `"arrow_fan_left"`) so cross-section references are readable.
4. **Namespace seeds by section** (e.g., section 1 uses 100xxx, section 2 uses 200xxx) to avoid collisions.
5. **Update cross-section bindings** as you go. When a new section's element needs to bind to an element from a previous section (e.g., an arrow connecting sections), edit the earlier element's `boundElements` array at the same time.

**Phase 2: Review the whole**

After all sections are in place, read through the complete JSON and check:
- Are cross-section arrows bound correctly on both ends?
- Is the overall spacing balanced, or are some sections cramped while others have too much whitespace?
- Do IDs and bindings all reference elements that actually exist?

Fix any alignment or binding issues before finishing.

**Phase 3: Self-review**

PNG rendering is disabled — do not run the render script. Re-read the full JSON and reason about the geometry to catch overlaps, clipping, and imbalanced composition. Fix issues directly in the JSON.

### Section Boundaries

Plan your sections around natural visual groupings from the diagram plan. A typical large diagram might split into:

- **Section 1**: Entry point / trigger
- **Section 2**: First decision or routing
- **Section 3**: Main content (hero section — may be the largest single section)
- **Section 4-N**: Remaining phases, outputs, etc.

Each section should be independently understandable: its elements, internal arrows, and any cross-references to adjacent sections.

### What NOT to Do

- **Don't generate the entire diagram in one response.** You will hit the output token limit and produce truncated, broken JSON. Even if the diagram is small enough to fit, splitting into sections produces better results.
- **Don't use a coding agent** to generate the JSON. The agent won't have sufficient context about the skill's rules, and the coordination overhead negates any benefit.
- **Don't write a Python generator script.** The templating and coordinate math seem helpful but introduce a layer of indirection that makes debugging harder. Hand-crafted JSON with descriptive IDs is more maintainable.

## Visual Pattern Library

### Fan-Out (One-to-Many)
Central element with arrows radiating to multiple targets. Use for: sources, PRDs, root causes, central hubs.
```
        ○
       ↗
  □ → ○
       ↘
        ○
```

### Convergence (Many-to-One)
Multiple inputs merging through arrows to single output. Use for: aggregation, funnels, synthesis.
```
  ○ ↘
  ○ → □
  ○ ↗
```

### Tree (Hierarchy)
Parent-child branching with connecting lines and free-floating text (no boxes needed). Use for: file systems, org charts, taxonomies.
```
  label
  ├── label
  │   ├── label
  │   └── label
  └── label
```
Use `line` elements for the trunk and branches, free-floating text for labels.

### Spiral/Cycle (Continuous Loop)
Elements in sequence with arrow returning to start. Use for: feedback loops, iterative processes, evolution.
```
  □ → □
  ↑     ↓
  □ ← □
```

### Cloud (Abstract State)
Overlapping ellipses with varied sizes. Use for: context, memory, conversations, mental states.

### Assembly Line (Transformation)
Input → Process Box → Output with clear before/after. Use for: transformations, processing, conversion.
```
  ○○○ → [PROCESS] → □□□
  chaos              order
```

### Side-by-Side (Comparison)
Two parallel structures with visual contrast. Use for: before/after, options, trade-offs.

### Gap/Break (Separation)
Visual whitespace or barrier between sections. Use for: phase changes, context resets, boundaries.

### Lines as Structure
Use lines (type: `line`, not arrows) as primary structural elements instead of boxes:
- **Timelines**: Vertical or horizontal line with small dots (10-20px ellipses) at intervals, free-floating labels beside each dot
- **Tree structures**: Vertical trunk line + horizontal branch lines, with free-floating text labels (no boxes needed)
- **Dividers**: Thin dashed lines to separate sections
- **Flow spines**: A central line that elements relate to, rather than connecting boxes

```
Timeline:           Tree:
  ●─── Label 1        │
  │                   ├── item
  ●─── Label 2        │   ├── sub
  │                   │   └── sub
  ●─── Label 3        └── item
```

Lines + free-floating text often creates a cleaner result than boxes + contained text.

## Shape Meaning

Choose shape based on what it represents—or use no shape at all:

| Concept Type | Shape | Why |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| Labels, descriptions, details | **none** (free-floating text) | Typography creates hierarchy |
| Section titles, annotations | **none** (free-floating text) | Font size/weight is enough |
| Markers on a timeline | small `ellipse` (10-20px) | Visual anchor, not container |
| Start, trigger, input | `ellipse` | Soft, origin-like |
| End, output, result | `ellipse` | Completion, destination |
| Decision, condition | `diamond` | Classic decision symbol |
| Process, action, step | `rectangle` | Contained action |
| Abstract state, context | overlapping `ellipse` | Fuzzy, cloud-like |
| Hierarchy node | lines + text (no boxes) | Structure through lines |

**Rule**: Default to no container. Add shapes only when they carry meaning. Aim for <30% of text elements to be inside containers.

---

## Color as Meaning

Colors encode information, not decoration. Every color choice should come from `references/color-palette.md` — the semantic shape colors, text hierarchy colors, and evidence artifact colors are all defined there.

**Key principles:**
- Each semantic purpose (start, end, decision, AI, error, etc.) has a specific fill/stroke pair
- Free-floating text uses color for hierarchy (titles, subtitles, details — each at a different level)
- Evidence artifacts (code snippets, JSON examples) use their own dark background + colored text scheme
- Always pair a darker stroke with a lighter fill for contrast

**Do not invent new colors.** If a concept doesn't fit an existing semantic category, use Primary/Neutral or Secondary.

---

## Visual Style: **draw.io-Clean (DEFAULT)**

산출물은 Excalidraw JSON 이지만 **draw.io / diagrams.net 로 그린 것처럼** 반듯하고 정형화돼야 한다 — 손그림(sketchy) 룩이 아니다. 사용자가 명시적으로 "손그림/스케치 느낌"을 요청할 때만 예외.

draw.io 시그니처 = 아래를 **전부** 지킬 것 (색은 `references/color-palette.md` = draw.io 팔레트가 SSOT):

1. **`roughness: 0`** — 모든 요소. 반듯한 선. (절대 `roughness: 1` 금지, 손그림 요청 시 제외)
2. **`fillStyle: "solid"`, `opacity: 100`** — 해칭·투명 금지. 연한 fill + 진한 stroke 쌍(팔레트).
3. **샤프한 90° 모서리** — 사각형 `"roundness": null`. 둥근 모서리는 의도적 "soft" 노드에만.
4. **산세리프 소형 폰트** — 라벨/제목 `fontFamily: 2`(Helvetica 계열), 코드·ID·SQL·값만 `fontFamily: 3`(mono). `fontSize` 13~16 소형·일관, 제목만 20~24. 손그림 폰트 `fontFamily: 1` **금지**.
5. **얇은 균일 선** — `strokeWidth: 1`(선·부차) ~ `2`(노드·주요 흐름).
6. **진한 회색 텍스트 `#333333`** — pastel fill 위에서도 유지(흰 글씨 X).
7. **그리드 정렬 레이아웃** — x/y/width/height 를 20px 그리드에 스냅하고 박스 모서리를 깔끔한 행/열로 정렬. jitter 없음.

### Connectors (draw.io 라우팅)

- **직선(2-point) 화살표가 기본.** `points: [[0,0],[dx,dy]]`, `roundness: null`, `endArrowhead: "arrow"`.
- 박스를 우회하거나 계층/분기를 표현할 때만 **직교(elbow)**: `points` 에 90° 꺾임점을 넣어 수평→수직으로 라우팅. L자 `[[0,0],[dx,0],[dx,dy]]`, Z자 `[[0,0],[dx/2,0],[dx/2,dy],[dx,dy]]`. **대각 꺾임은 피한다.**
- 화살표 `strokeColor` = 출발 노드의 stroke 색(팔레트 쌍) 또는 `#333333`. 비활성 연결은 `strokeStyle: "dashed"`.

### Stroke Width
- `strokeWidth: 1` — Thin, elegant. Good for lines, dividers, subtle connections.
- `strokeWidth: 2` — Standard. Good for shapes and primary arrows.
- `strokeWidth: 3` — Bold. Use sparingly for emphasis (main flow line, key connections).

### Opacity
**Always use `opacity: 100` for all elements.** Use color, size, and stroke width to create hierarchy instead of transparency.

### Small Markers Instead of Shapes
Instead of full shapes, use small dots (10-20px ellipses) as:
- Timeline markers
- Bullet points
- Connection nodes
- Visual anchors for free-floating text

---

## Layout Principles

### Hierarchy Through Scale
- **Hero**: 300×150 - visual anchor, most important
- **Primary**: 180×90
- **Secondary**: 120×60
- **Small**: 60×40

### Whitespace = Importance
The most important element has the most empty space around it (200px+).

### Flow Direction
Guide the eye: typically left→right or top→bottom for sequences, radial for hub-and-spoke.

### Connections Required
Position alone doesn't show relationships. If A relates to B, there must be an arrow.

---

## Text Rules

**CRITICAL**: The JSON `text` property contains ONLY readable words.

```json
{
  "id": "myElement1",
  "text": "Start",
  "originalText": "Start"
}
```

Settings: `fontSize: 14`, `fontFamily: 2` (산세리프 — draw.io 기본; 코드/값만 `3` mono), `textAlign: "center"`, `verticalAlign: "middle"`

---

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "type": "excalidraw",
  "version": 2,
  "source": "https://excalidraw.com",
  "elements": [...],
  "appState": {
    "viewBackgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "gridSize": 20
  },
  "files": {}
}
```

## Element Templates

See `references/element-templates.md` for copy-paste JSON templates for each element type (text, line, dot, rectangle, arrow). Pull colors from `references/color-palette.md` based on each element's semantic purpose.

---

## Self-Review (rendering disabled)

PNG rendering is turned OFF for this skill. Do NOT run `render_excalidraw.py`, do NOT install the renderer, and do NOT create any `.png` files. The `.excalidraw` JSON is the only deliverable — the user views it directly in Obsidian's Excalidraw plugin.

Because you cannot see a rendered image, review the JSON extra carefully by reasoning about the geometry:

- **Overlap check**: For every pair of shapes, confirm their x/y/width/height rectangles don't unintentionally overlap. Leave clear gaps.
- **Text fit**: Each container must be wide/tall enough for its text. Rough rule: width >= (longest line chars * fontSize * 0.6) + padding; height >= (lines * fontSize * lineHeight) + padding.
- **Arrow bindings**: Every arrow's startBinding/endBinding must reference elements that exist, and its points should actually reach from source to target.
- **Spacing & balance**: Similar elements evenly spaced; no large empty voids next to cramped clusters.
- **Flow**: Trace the eye path top->bottom / left->right and confirm it matches the intended argument.

Fix any issue directly in the JSON before finishing. When in doubt, add more whitespace — it's the safest default without a visual check.
---

## Quality Checklist

### Depth & Evidence (Check First for Technical Diagrams)
1. **Research done**: Did you look up actual specs, formats, event names?
2. **Evidence artifacts**: Are there code snippets, JSON examples, or real data?
3. **Multi-zoom**: Does it have summary flow + section boundaries + detail?
4. **Concrete over abstract**: Real content shown, not just labeled boxes?
5. **Educational value**: Could someone learn something concrete from this?

### Conceptual
6. **Isomorphism**: Does each visual structure mirror its concept's behavior?
7. **Argument**: Does the diagram SHOW something text alone couldn't?
8. **Variety**: Does each major concept use a different visual pattern?
9. **No uniform containers**: Avoided card grids and equal boxes?

### Container Discipline
10. **Minimal containers**: Could any boxed element work as free-floating text instead?
11. **Lines as structure**: Are tree/timeline patterns using lines + text rather than boxes?
12. **Typography hierarchy**: Are font size and color creating visual hierarchy (reducing need for boxes)?

### Structural
13. **Connections**: Every relationship has an arrow or line
14. **Flow**: Clear visual path for the eye to follow
15. **Hierarchy**: Important elements are larger/more isolated

### Technical
16. **Text clean**: `text` contains only readable words
17. **Font (draw.io)**: `fontFamily: 2` (산세리프) for labels; `fontFamily: 3` (mono) only for code/IDs/values
18. **draw.io look**: `roughness: 0` · `fillStyle: "solid"` · rectangles `"roundness": null` (샤프) · 팔레트 fill/stroke 쌍 · 텍스트 `#333333` · 커넥터 직선 또는 직교(대각 X) · 20px 그리드 정렬
19. **Opacity**: `opacity: 100` for all elements (no transparency)
20. **Container ratio**: <30% of text elements should be inside containers

### Self-Review (No Rendering)
21. **No render performed**: You did NOT run the render script or create a PNG.
22. **No text overflow**: Containers are sized to fit their text (checked by geometry).
23. **No overlapping elements**: Shape rectangles don't unintentionally overlap.
24. **Even spacing**: Similar elements have consistent spacing.
25. **Arrows land correctly**: Bindings reference real elements; points reach source->target.
26. **Readable sizes**: Font sizes large enough to read (>=12 detail, >=16 labels).
27. **Balanced composition**: No large empty voids or overcrowded regions.
